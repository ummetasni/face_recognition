HOW TO ADD YOUR FACE FOR RECOGNITION
=====================================

1. PUT YOUR PHOTOS HERE
   - Add 1-3 photos of yourself (or other people you want to recognize)
   - Name the file with the person's name
   - Example: "YourName.jpg" or "John.jpg"

2. PHOTO REQUIREMENTS
   - Clear, front-facing photos work best
   - Good lighting
   - Face clearly visible
   - Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp

3. HOW MANY PHOTOS?
   - Minimum: 1 good photo
   - Recommended: 2-3 photos (different angles help!)
   - Best: 3-5 photos with different expressions

4. EXAMPLE:
   - YourName.jpg
   - YourName2.jpg  (optional - for better accuracy)
   - FriendName.jpg (you can add multiple people)

5. AFTER ADDING PHOTOS:
   - Run: python main.py
   - Or press 'r' while running to reload faces

The name in the filename is what will be displayed when recognized!
